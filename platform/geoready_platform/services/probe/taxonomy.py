"""Buyer-intent prompt taxonomy.

Pure data. ``TAXONOMY_VERSION`` is persisted on every probe run/response so
historical comparisons remain valid when the taxonomy changes.

Each category carries three booleans:
- ``includes_name``: the templates embed the business name. If true, the model
  is *handed* the brand, so a "mention" is trivial and MUST NOT count toward
  Share-of-Model.
- ``counts_for_share``: answers feed Share-of-Model. This is allowed ONLY for
  **discovery** prompts — category + location/problem, NO business name — where
  the model must surface the business *independently*. Enforced invariant:
  ``counts_for_share`` implies ``not includes_name`` and no ``{name}`` token.
- ``counts_for_factual``: answers feed hallucination detection (name-bearing,
  direct questions about the business).

WHY (v3): earlier versions let the name-bearing ``comparison`` category count
toward Share-of-Model. Asking "alternatives to {name}" hands the model the brand,
so even a fictional business scored SoM 1.0. SoM is now discovery-only.
